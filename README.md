Can view table here : [mentorship_eligibilty.csv](https://github.com/fisher-n/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv) 

- There are 1,551 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program.
- The company has less employees who can one-on-one mentor new hires than the number of new hires needed.

## Summary


The company will need to hire at least 72,458 employees as the “Silver Tsunami” begins to impact. There are currently not enough eligible employee mentors to train the next generation of new hires. With the current program each mentor would need to teach roughly 72 employees. By adjusting the parameters for eligible mentors, the company can come up with a better solution to help new hires. By creating a query based on year of retirement the company could create a better plan for new hires and training.


Majority of the rehire efforts would be to fill positions for Senior Engineers and Senior Staff
